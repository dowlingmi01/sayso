					<h2 class="sb_title">About Say.So</h2>
					<p>What is Say.So? Say.So is where <em>your</em> "say so" has value. This all started because we had been duped. Enticed into joining research panels with the promise that our opinions would matter, and that our input would be reflected in new or improved products. Instead, what we got was mailboxes filled with irrelevant surveys, points systems that offered very little reward, and no other way to demonstrate that we are mavens who should be revered.</p>
					<p>Say.So's mission is to give you -- consumers, fans, brand acolytes, pundits -- an elegant way to more intimately connect with your favorite brands and affinities. In return, these companies learn how best to serve you, their customer. But, for this to truly mean something, the experience needs to be worthwhile.</p>
					<p>Say.So's experience is unique in that it is a browser application, not a web page, so interacting with it doesn't require you to leave what you are doing. It's there when you are ready and keeps you notified of new surveys, content and rewards. The app offers a variety of surveys and polls, but also powers activities that are intrinsically motivating – quests, trivia... These test your mettle. Some are available to you out of the gate, but others need to be earned by leveling up or demonstrating your unique knowledge.</p>
					<p>The more you participate, the more you gain, earning both experience points and currency points. Experience points are the currency of influence, earned by sharing your experience, expertise and opinion. These determine your status in the community, and reaching higher levels separates you as someone to be heard. Currency points are almost as good as cash and can be redeemed for a variety of unique and only available to you merchandise.</p>
					<p>Say.So. <em>What's yours?</em></p>

						<strong>Do you really give away the prizes?</strong><br />
						YES! Every prize that is won will be shipped to within 4-6 Weeks. You guys will get the prizes for playing, not the CEO's nephew or cousin.

						No you do not have to play every day, but the more you play, the better chance you have at winning a weekly prize or even the monthly prize. The more you participate, the more points you will earn, and the more points you earn, the better chance you have the winning prizes.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Can I stop playing at any time?</strong><br />
