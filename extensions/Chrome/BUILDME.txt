In order to build this software you must

1. Start Google Chrome
2. In the url bar, enter chrome://extensions and hit enter
3. Enable Developer mode (top right) if it is not enabled already
4. Click "Pack extension..."
5. Select the ChromeExt folder on your computer.
6. Leave the Private key file blank for now, you don't have one yet. We can share the same one later once we have a working version. This is used so we can release updates (you need to compile updates with the same private key as previous versions).
7. Click "Pack Extension".


Files to edit
ChromeExt\manifest.json - Edit name only
