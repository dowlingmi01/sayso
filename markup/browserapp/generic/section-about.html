	<h2>About Machinima|Recon</h2>

	<p>Our mission is to give you -- our audience, fans, acolytes, pundits -- a better way to connect with Machinima. In
		return, we learn how best to serve you, our fans. But, for this to truly mean something, the experience needs to
		be worthwhile.
	</p>

	<p>The Recon experience is unique in that it is a browser application, not a web page, so interacting with it
		doesn't require you to leave what you are doing. It's there when you are ready and keeps you notified of new
		surveys, content and rewards. The app offers a variety of surveys and polls, but is also full of fun stuff like
		- trivia, trailers, contests and content exclusive to Recon members. Some are available to you out of the gate,
		but others need to be earned by leveling up or demonstrating your unique knowledge.
	</p>

	<p>The more you participate, the more you gain, earning both experience points (xp) and redeemable currency (coins).
		Experience points will get you more influence and are earned by sharing your experience, expertise and opinion.
		These determine your status in the community - reaching higher levels separates you from the crowd as someone to
		be heard.
	</p>

	<p>Redeemable currency points are almost as good as cash and can be redeemed for all sorts of schwag, including
		Machinima gear.
	</p>

	<p>We need you to take point in our mission to ever improve Machinima and our content offerings.</p>

	<p>Recon!</p>

<script data-partial-id="billofrights" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
	<div class="sayso-element sayso-scrollable" style="height: 494px;">
		<h2>Say.So Member Bill of Rights</h2>
		<div>
			<p>In order to ensure members are openly and unequivocally made aware of the core values embodied by Say.So with which we imbue our member relations and product roadmap, we provide this Say.So Member Bill of Rights.
			</p></div>

		<h3>(1) Say.So</h3>
		<div><p>Above all else, members' say-so will be honored and exalted. Your influence, opinion and personal authority are the core reason for the existence of Say.So.
		</p></div>

		<h3>(2) Consent - Unambiguous Opt-In</h3>
		<div><p>By agreeing to participate in a Say.So community you accept that from time to time anonymous usage, behavioral, and poll/survey data will be collected, but we will never collect personally identifiable or sensitive information without your explicit permission.
		</p></div>

		<h3>(3) Anonymity</h3>
		<div><p>
			No personally identifiable information will be associated to your member account – ever. You will remain anonymous – what we know about you is what you agree to provide us. Period.
		</p></div>

		<h3>(4) Transparency</h3>
		<div><p>
			You have the right to know how Say.So uses your anonymous information and not see details buried deep in the "terms and conditions". Hence, this Bill of Rights, which will be posted in multiple, easily accessible places. We will also provide you several ways to provide feedback and input on how we're doing and hope you don’t hesitate to share your thoughts, concerns, opinions, suggestions.</p></div>

		<h3>(5) Privacy</h3>
		<div><p>
			Say.So will keep all data you provide to us private – your email address, or personally identifiable info we may need to collect to send you rewards (e.g. name, physical
			address, phone number). This information will not be sold or given to third-parties. Not gonna happen.
		</p></div>

		<h3>(6) Fun</h3>
		<div><p>
			It is a member's right to enjoy themselves, and to let Say.So know what is fun, relevant and interesting, and what is lame and boring (please be kind). Though Say.So will sometimes need to ask you to do a few boring things so we can pay the bills, Say.So will always ensure the product roadmap reflects more fun stuff than boring stuff. We're listening!
		</p></div>

		<h3>(7) Reward</h3>
		<div><p>
			Say.So members have a right to be rewarded for their Say.So. That will be provided in the form of exclusive access and privileges, as well as through explicit rewards like redeemable points or simple cash.
		</p></div>
