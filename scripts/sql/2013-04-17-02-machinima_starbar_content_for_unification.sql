But, for this to truly mean something, the experience needs to be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>The Recon experience is unique in that it is a browser application, not a web page, so interacting with it doesn''t require you to leave what you are doing. It''s there when you are ready and keeps you notified of new surveys, content and rewards. The app offers a variety of surveys and polls, but is also full of fun stuff like - trivia, trailers, contests and content exclusive to Recon members. Some are available to you out of the gate, but others need to be earned by leveling up or demonstrating your unique knowledge.</p>\n<p>The more you participate, the more you gain, earning both experience points (xp) and redeemable currency (coins). Experience points will get you more influence and are earned by sharing your experience, expertise and opinion. These determine your status in the community - reaching higher levels separates you from the crowd as someone to be heard.</p>\n<p>Redeemable currency points are almost as good as cash and can be redeemed for all sorts of schwag, including Machinima gear.</p>\n<p>We need you to take point in our mission to ever improve Machinima and our content offerings.</p>\n\n<p>Recon!</em></p>' WHERE starbar_id = 4 AND starbar_content_key_id = 7;
